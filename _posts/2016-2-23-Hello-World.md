# Bioluminescent Film as Food Quality Marker 

## The Plan

<br><bold>
<br>Plan 2:(more manageable)<br>
<br>1. Investigate and Create "Protective" Biofilm Against Produce Contamination<br>
<br>2. Coat Produce with Biofilm<br>
<br>3. Find way of monitoring Biofilm and maintaining it for food quality maintenance<br>
<bold><br>

Plan 1:(too convoluted)
A BioHack project - Food Safety Solutions with Biomarkers, Sensors and Dispensers In this project I aim to make a fresh greens storage and transport system that conserves the integrety (prevents from spoilage and or contamination) of the produce by monitoring the level of a coloured biomarker and reacting against the contamination by spraying the produce with baterial inhibitor.


This will involve the following research and experimental streams 

1. Microbiology: Selection, Study and Culturing of Microorganism to be used as biomarker. I.E. Bioluminescent indicator or Color Indicator? How to make the idicator species resistant to the bacterial contamination inhibitor? How to coat produce with enough indicator species? Key concepts: Biofilm formation, pro-quorum sensing mechanism, bacterial media. Issues: How to recycle the dead bacteria w/ new ones? What is the optimal growth rate and conditions, are they congruent with necessary conditions for storage of greens? Will greens need to be stored in cool place/what causes spoilage, wilting, contamination apart from microorganic "invasion" and change in humidity? How will the biofilm be removed before consumption if it is not edible? 

2. Design of Storage Container: 3D CAD drawing and material cutting and assembling. Determine properties required for container i.e. size limit, shape, ventilation, powering mode, isulation and or isolation mechanisms.

3. Design of Control Mechanisms: Input Type (bioluminescence levels? - if so, threshold? must be in dark environment? what kind of sensor to be used?, color levels? - if so, similar qts as for bioluminescence). QT: Do the biomarkers really have to be color/luminescent? Coding and testing for input information thresholds and for output information reactions - i.e. Spray with inhibitor, lower temperature? spary with pro-quorum sensing promoter for the indicator species? 

4. Testing and optimising the whole system
